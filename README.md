Our project is mainly focussed towards working IT professionals who find no time to take care of their mental amd physical well being. Our website begins with a home page that asks the customer to choose between two options that we've given - mental health or physical health.
If the user chooses the mental health option, he gets redirected to a page which has several mental well being facilities available like Counsellors available nearby,Motivational Classes, Stress Management Techniques, Creating chatgroups for like minded people to come, etc   
If the user chooses the physical health option, he gets redirected to another page with 2 options - Workouts & diets.
The diet section mainly focusses on various diets available and information regarding them like the calorie infomations and related data that they can get from a particular diet.
The workout section mainly focusses on various workouts related to arms, legs, chest, posture and whole body.
Each of the sections have videos with varying time spans so that user can use with his time schedule.
After the above page, we have a page regarding the monetary features which is the main focus of our project.
The monetary investment initially asks for a certain amount of money from the customer which is under his budget and the breakdown of this money is given below:
The money will be safely deposited in our personalized accounts, If the user is successfully consistent in the workouts.a certain amount will be deducted to buy health realted essentials which will be customized.
If the user is comfortable with the suggestions of the products we give, we will deliver the products as soon as possible.
Free plans are also available for first timers.

Future ideas to be integrated :
*Ai chatbot for faq
*integrating machine learning algorithms to provide better recommendationÂ systems
*Discounts in the form of rewards like coins if they complete the videos on time without enabling the skipping and fast forwarding options.
*Alerts and notifications.
