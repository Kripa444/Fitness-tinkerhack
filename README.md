Our project mainly focuses on working IT professionals who have no time to take care of their mental and physical well-being. Our website begins with a home page asking the customer to choose between two options we've given - mental health or physical health.
If the user chooses the mental health option, he gets redirected to a page that has several mental well-being facilities available like Counsellors available nearby, Motivational Classes, Stress Management Techniques, Creating chat groups for like-minded people to come together, etc   
If the user chooses the physical health option, he gets redirected to another page with 2 options - Workouts & diets.
The diet section mainly focuses on various diets available and information regarding them like the calorie information and related data that they can get from a particular diet.
The workout section mainly focuses on various workouts related to arms, legs, chest, posture, and whole body.
Each of the section has videos with varying periods so that the user can use them with his schedule.
After the above page, we have a page regarding the monetary features which is the main focus of our project.
The monetary investment initially asks for a certain amount of money from the customer which would be under his budget and the breakdown of this invested money is given below:
The money will be safely deposited in our personalized accounts. If the user is successfully consistent in the workouts,a certain amount will be deducted to buy health realted essentials which will be customized.
The money will be deducted only at regular intervals, say 2 weeks, and also if he is consistent with it.
If the user is comfortable with the suggestions of the products we give, we will deliver the products as soon as possible.
Free plans are also available for first-timers.

Future ideas to be integrated :
*Ai chatbot for faq
*integrating machine learning algorithms to provide better recommendationÂ systems
*Discounts in the form of rewards like coins if they complete the videos on time without enabling the skipping and fast-forwarding options.
*Alerts and notifications.

We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, and Python Flask to create this project.
